# Pi-DJ

Do you want to make your own standalone DJ deck using a Raspberry Pi and a MIDI DJ deck like the Pioneer DDJ-400? Pi-DJ makes it easy to run the open-source DJ software [Mixxx](#TODO) on your Raspberry Pi 4B (other models not tested).

## TODO

- link to Mixxx

Pi-DJ's OS is generated using a personal fork of [RPi-Distro/pi-gen](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen/tree/arm64). The modifications I made on top are heavily based on and inspired by [fayaaz/mixxx-pi-gen](https://github.com/fayaaz/mixxx-pi-gen). A big thank you go out to both of these distros and their authors!
